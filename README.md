# First-Repository
My very first Github repository, specifically created to apply to the RStudio 2019 Summer Internship

This repository includes a few assignments from my coursework at UNC-Chapel Hill.

The "Computational Part" folder is from an assignment in my statistics class STOR 565: Machine Learning class.

The "Exploratory Data Analysis" folder is from an assignment in my statistics class STOR 320: Intro to Data Science.

The "LING 460 - Project 1" folder is from an assignment in my linguistics class called "Intro to Textual Data Analysis."


*At my university, STOR stands for the department of Statistics and Operations Research.
